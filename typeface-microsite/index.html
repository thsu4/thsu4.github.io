        "All grown-ups were once children... but only few of them remember it."
    </h2>
    <h5>

        <p>
            The narrator begins his story by reflecting on the limits of adult imagination. As a child, he once drew a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant, but every adult who saw it thought it was a hat. Disheartened by their lack of understanding, he gave up drawing and pursued a more "reasonable" career—becoming a pilot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Years later, after crashing in the Sahara Desert, he meets a golden-haired boy who asks him to draw a sheep. This boy, the Little Prince, appears mysteriously and with profound curiosity, immediately challenging the narrator's grown-up sensibilities. Their meeting marks the beginning of a tale that reconnects the narrator—and the reader—with forgotten childhood truths. The Prince's simple yet mysterious presence in the desert is a stark contrast to the practical adult world the narrator had come to accept. Through him, the story critiques how adults often fail to see what truly matters, placing the reader in a position to rediscover a more intuitive, emotional way of viewing the world.
        </p>

    <h2>
        "Please… draw me a sheep."
    </h2>
    <h5>
        <p>
            The first request the Little Prince makes is deceptively simple, yet it leads to a powerful connection. The narrator, taken aback and slightly annoyed, tries several times to draw a sheep that satisfies the Prince. None of them are right—too old, too sickly, too horned—until finally, in frustration, the narrator draws a simple box and says the sheep is inside. The Little Prince is delighted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This moment is magical; it reveals how the Prince values imagination over literalism. He sees beyond the drawing to what it represents. It also shows how children interact with the world through creativity and emotional understanding, rather than analysis. This bond, formed in the middle of a barren desert, sets the tone for the rest of the story—a journey through stories, memories, and lessons from the Prince's life and travels. The sheep becomes symbolic of many things: innocence, responsibility, and the fragile beauty of the things we love.

        "I am not afraid of tigers, but I have a horror of drafts."
    </h2>
    <h5>
        <p>
            Through conversations, the Little Prince begins to reveal details of his home planet, Asteroid B-612. There, he tended three volcanoes (one possibly extinct), pulled up invasive baobab sprouts, and, most importantly, cared for a mysterious flower. This flower—beautiful, proud, and temperamental—captivated him. Though she asked for screens against drafts and acted vainly, he later realizes that she truly loved him. At the time, her pride and cryptic affection confused him, leading him to leave his planet. This memory haunts him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The flower, though outwardly fragile and demanding, symbolizes a deeper emotional truth: the vulnerability and complexity of love. The Prince did not understand her at first, but through his journey, he learns that love is about actions, not words. Her seemingly irrational fears and dramatic flair weren’t flaws but expressions of a deep, unspoken bond.
        </p>

    <h2>
        "It is such a secret place, the land of tears."
    </h2>
    <h5>
    <p>
        As the Prince continues his tale, he recounts his travels to other planets, each inhabited by an adult trapped in absurd concerns—a king with no subjects, a vain man craving admiration, a drunkard drinking to forget, a businessman counting stars, a lamplighter lost in duty, and a geographer who never sees the world he records. These figures parody adult behavior, portraying it as self-centered, unthinking, and tragically repetitive. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Prince is bewildered and saddened by these grown-ups who have lost their sense of wonder and purpose. His tears come not from fear or loneliness, but from the realization that love and meaning have been replaced by distraction and control. These moments deepen his emotional maturity and heighten his longing for the rose he left behind. The narrator, witnessing these stories, begins to reconnect with his own lost emotional clarity.
    </p>

    <h2>
        "You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed."
    </h2>
    <h5>
        <p>
            The pivotal moment in the Prince’s journey comes when he meets the fox. The fox teaches him the meaning of taming—to build ties, to make someone or something unique to you. Through this lesson, the Prince realizes that his rose, though one of many in appearance, is irreplaceable because of the time and love he gave her. The fox’s words carry a profound emotional weight: true relationships are not found but made, and once forged, they carry responsibility. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The Prince is moved by the wheat fields that now remind the fox of his golden hair, a new association born from love. The Prince internalizes this truth, affirming that love is not about rarity, but about shared experience and care. This chapter is the heart of the story, merging innocence and wisdom in a way only the language of childhood can express.
        </p>
    </h5>
    <h2>
        "What is essential is invisible to the eye."
    </h2>
    <h5>
        <p>
            Before the Prince says goodbye to the fox, the fox shares his most precious secret: what matters most cannot be seen, only felt. The Prince repeats this over and over to remember it. This insight reframes the entire story. The rose, the sheep, the Prince himself—none of them can be measured or categorized the way adults try to do. Their worth lies in their meaning to someone else. The narrator, too, begins to grasp this truth, realizing that the plane he must fix, the desert around him, and even the Prince’s presence are all secondary to the emotional realities beneath them. This wisdom marks a turning point for the narrator, who begins to see his mechanical world in a new light—not as a place of failure and survival, but one of hidden truths and fragile beauty.
        </p>

        "I can carry you farther than any ship could take you."
    </h2>

    <p>
        Eventually, the Prince reveals his decision to return to his planet and his rose. To do so, he will allow a snake to bite him, leaving behind his body like a shell. The narrator is devastated, but the Prince comforts him, promising that he will continue to live on—in the laughter of stars, in the unseen truths he has revealed. The snake, once a symbol of fear, becomes a bridge to transcendence.   
    </p>
    <p>
        The Prince’s departure is both an ending and a beginning. His body disappears, but his essence—his teachings, his love, his joy—remains. The narrator now understands that true presence is not physical. He asks readers, when they look at the stars, to wonder if the sheep has eaten the rose. This open-ended question ensures the story continues in the reader’s imagination, where what is essential remains forever visible to the heart.
